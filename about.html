  <h2>About Ember Bites</h2>
  <p>
    Ember Bites are a collection of Ember tutorials written by <a href='http://ryanbigg.com'>Ryan Bigg</a>. These tutorials cover primarily the use of Ember within the context of a Rails app. As such, all the code examples are contained within Rails apps, which are very easy to run!

    I didn't want to do screencasts because I can't listen to my own voice without it feeling weird. Oh, and updating screencasts is a huge pain in the bum compared with updating text. Another great thing about text is that text can receive pull requests. You can also copy and paste from text, which I hear people are fond of.

    The code for everything is available on the <a href='http://github.com/emberbites'>Ember Bites GitHub Organisation</a>. If you'd like me to write about something, please <a href='http://github.com/emberbites/emberbites/issues'>File an issue about it!</a> If you would like to write about something, pull requests are very welcome!

    I'm mainly writing all this down so I don't forget. I used this technique to learn Rails and ended up writing two books about it. I've only got plans to write smallish posts about Ember for the time being, and that's what you'll see here.
