title: Ember Bites - What

<div id="what">
  <p>
    Ember Bites are a collection of Ember tutorials written by <a href='http://ryanbigg.com'>Ryan Bigg</a>. Covering primarily the use of Ember within the context of a Rails app. As such, all the code examples are contained within Rails apps, which are very easy to run!

    I'm mainly writing all this down so I don't forget. I used this technique to learn Rails and ended up writing two books about it. I've only got plans to write small blog posts about Ember for the time being, and that's what you'll see here.
